Patches to support MacBookPro 16,1 Wifi, Audio, Bluetooth, SMC, Keyboard and Touchpad on kernel 5.6, tweaked from the originals from @aunali1 and @mikeeq

To make this work you'll also need the BCE drivers from @mcmrarm

Note that while the Wifi card in the 16,1 will be detected, at the moment there is no known working firmware. The model appears to be different to the BCM4364 in the MBP15,2 so no pre-Catalina firmware exists for the card.
